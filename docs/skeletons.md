This doc is detected towards monitoring technical debt, implementation callouts,
and future work.

## Technical Debt

## Implementation Callouts

* `Model Entity` class does not deserialize it's data properly. See this github
issue for more details: [#10](https://github.com/cdklabs/awscdk-change-analyzer/issues/10)

## Future Work

* Find a sustainable way of implementing integration tests with the CLI. See this
github issue for more details: [#13](https://github.com/cdklabs/awscdk-change-analyzer/issues/13)
